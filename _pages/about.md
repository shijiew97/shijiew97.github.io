I am Shijie Wang, currenlty a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/statistics/) under supervision of Prof. [Ray Bai](https://raybai.net/). My primary research focuses on utilizing deep learning to address, improve and facitilite statistical inference in the following classcial statistics models:
- Bootstrap uncertainty quantification
- Nonparametric conditional density estimation and nonparametric multi-quantile estimation
- Emprical Bayes and nonparameteric maximum likelihood estimation
